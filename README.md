# Connect-4-game
Connect four is a two-player board game in which the players alternately drop colored disks into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid.

The objective of the game is to connect four same-colored disks in a row, a column, or a diagonal before your opponent can do likewise. The program prompts two players to drop a RED or YELLOW disk alternately. Whenever a disk is dropped, the program re-displays the board on the console and determines the status of the game (win, draw, or continue).
